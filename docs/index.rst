pyalab documentation
====================

Pyalab allows you to use Python to generate programs for ViaLab to control an Integra Assist Plus liquid handling robot.

Once generated, the files can be simulated within ViaLab and further edited if needed.

At the moment, a limited subset of the full functionality of ViaLab is implemented, but more is being added each day.
